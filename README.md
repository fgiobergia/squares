# Squares

*Squares* is your average "jump the obstacles" we all know (if you don't, your internet connection is pretty damn robust).

Use the spacebar to jump (also, you can jump again mid-air to "double-jump"). When you hit an obstacle, you lose. Press spacebar again to restart. 

Powered javascript + [p5.js](http://p5js.org/)
